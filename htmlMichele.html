                    One thing, I don't know why
                    It doesn't even matter how hard you try
                    Keep that in mind
                    I designed this rhyme
                    To remind myself of a time when
                    I tried so hard
                    In spite of the way you were mocking me
                    Acting like I was part of your property
                    Remembering all the times you fought with me
                    I'm surprised it got so
                    Things aren't the way they were before
                    You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
                    Not that you knew me back then
                    But it all comes back to me in the end
                    You kept everything inside
                    And even though I tried, it all fell apart
                    What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when</p>
